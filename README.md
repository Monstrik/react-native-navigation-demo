## Requirements

Node 8 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 9 or up, and will target iOS 9 and up.

You also need to install the dependencies required by React Native:

- for [Android development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies-3)
- for [iOS development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#installing-dependencies)


## Run demo

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can setup and run the project by running:

- `yarn` to install the dependencies
- `yarn start`  to run the iOS application on IPad simulator
- `react-native run-android` to run the Android application (remember to start a simulator or connect an Android phone)
- `react-native run-ios` to run the iOS application (remember to start a simulator or connect an iPhone phone)
